##  The Problem

Today, crypto ownership is heavily skewed toward younger generations. **Baby Boomers only have 10% of crypto ownership**, and Gen X isn't far ahead. They are being left out of a huge technological advancement simply because the onboarding process is intimidating, complex, and lacks a personal touch.

How do we bridge this gap? It's up to those of us who are already crypto-native to find simple, trustworthy ways to bring our friends and family into the ecosystem.

##  The Solution: Offbeat Greets

**Offbeat Greets** are digital, artisanal greeting cards with crypto attached.

It’s a new type of digital connection that bridges the gap between those who used to know no internet and those who call themselves “chronically online.”

Instead of a complex 20-step tutorial, Offbeat Greets lowers the obstacle and fear of starting. The onboarding comes from a trusted source—a friend or loved one—celebrating a real-world moment with a digital card.

All you have to do is send them an Offbeat Greet, and they get:
* Their first crypto wallet
* Their first NFT (the greeting card)
* Their first tokens

##  How It Works

The process is designed to be simple for both the sender and the recipient.

### For the Sender (Crypto-Native):
1.  Connect your existing wallet to the Offbeat Greets app.
2.  Choose a digital greeting card (NFT).
3.  Add a message and attach some crypto (e.g., ETH, USDC) as a gift.
4.  Enter the recipient's email address and send!

### For the Recipient (New to Web3):
1.  Receive a friendly email with a link to their Offbeat Greet.
2.  With just a few clicks, they can instantly create a new, secure crypto wallet tied to their email (e.g., using Magic Wallet).
3.  Once their wallet is created, they automatically receive the NFT (the card) and the gifted tokens.
4.  Welcome to web3!
